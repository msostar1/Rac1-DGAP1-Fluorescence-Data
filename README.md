# Rac1-DGAP1-Fluorescence-Data

This dataset consists of MATLAB data files obtained by analyzing Rac1* and DGAP1# fluorescence data using Quimp software. Each file corresponds to the analysis of an individual cell. The files are organized into three separate folders: one for cells that exhibited rotating and oscillating patterns, one for cells with stationary (polarized) patterns, and one for cells that did not exhibit any particular pattern (random).

The dataset was generated using confocal microscopy to capture fluorescence data from two distinct channels, corresponding to Rac1* and DGAP1# signals. Cells expressing fluorescent probes for these proteins were imaged over time. The raw fluorescence data were processed using Quimp software, which extracted and segmented fluorescence intensities along the cell membrane across all time points. The processed data was then saved in MATLAB format, capturing the spatiotemporal distribution of Rac1* and DGAP1# for each cell.

It can be used in conjunction provided MATLAB codes
