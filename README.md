In the supplementary materials, we include MATLAB codes and accompanying MATLAB data files that enable the reproduction of the results and images presented in this manuscript (Rac1-DGAP1 Fluorescence Data). Additionally, we supply movies and microscopy files used for generating Figures 1, 2, S1, S2 and S7.

Rac1-DGAP1 Fluorescence Dataset consists of MATLAB data files obtained by analyzing Rac1* and DGAP1# fluorescence data using Quimp software. Each file corresponds to the analysis of an individual cell. The files are organized into three separate folders: 
1. rot_osc_ordered: for cells that exhibited rotating and oscillating patterns,
2. pol_ordered: for cells with stationary (polar) patterns,
3. random: for cells that did not exhibit any particular pattern.

Below is a concise description of the codes provided:
**model_FDM_1D.m**

Solves a set of partial differential equations (PDEs) by discretizing the spatial domain into 100 equally spaced points. The results include kymographs for all seven dependent variables, an autocorrelogram for R_T (generated using the function autocorrelogramFunction.m, which is provided as a separate file), and the phase portrait showing the relationship between membrane-bound Rac1 and DGAP1. Additionally, this code can also be used to generate Figures 4A, 4B, 4C, and the right part of Fig5A.
**model_FDM_2D.m**
Two-dimensional version of the finite difference code used in model_FDM_1D.m. This code solves the set of equations corresponding to cycle I in the model, using a disk as the spatial domain. It can be used to generate Fig9C.
**LSA_FigS4A.m**
Performs linear stability analysis for a specified set of parameters. The analysis begins by computing the system's steady state or fixed point (using the m_SS.m function provided as a separate file). It then proceeds to calculate the Jacobian matrix J and the eigenvalues of the matrix M_q=J-q^2 D, from which the stability of steady state can be determined. Additionally, it plots the growth rate as a function of wave number, corresponding to FigS5A. A slightly modified version can be used to reproduce the left part of Fig5A, and Fig5B.
**kymographs_exp.m**
This script reads Quimp analysis data (files of the form data_FigX.mat). It then interpolates and smooths the data, and plots kymographs and autocorrelograms for the specified time interval. It is used to generate the experimental parts of Fig6, FigS4, and Fig7.
**PCA.m**
Reads Quimp analysis data from the file data_PCA.mat, interpolates this data across a defined spatial and temporal grid, and proceeds with performing principal component analysis. Following the analysis, it plots elements of Fig8, and Fig10.
**stat_ana_FigS5B.m**
Performs the Kruskal-Wallis statistical test to compare the measured circumferences of cells exhibiting first-order oscillatory patterns, second-order oscillatory patterns, and first-order stationary patterns. The data used for this comparison is contained in the file data_stats_mod_v_size.mat.
**noise_analysis_S6Fig.m**
This MATLAB code analyzes the noise profile of YFP intensity data corresponding to the Rac1* signal. It performs a variance-stabilizing transformation, applies a high-pass Butterworth filter to remove low-frequency patterns, and computes the power spectral density (PSD) of the filtered data. The code then visualizes both the averaged PSD (FigS6) and the time-resolved PSD.
**crosscorrelation_Fig2D_Fig2E.m**
This MATLAB code processes fluorescence data from YFP and mRFP channels corresponding to Rac1* and DGAP1# signals, respectively. It interpolates and smooths the data, then calculates the Pearson correlation coefficients for the first 120 seconds of activity across multiple cells. The results for each cell are stored, and a box plot of the Pearson correlation coefficients is generated to visualize the data (Fig2D). A slight modification can be used to generate Fig2E.
